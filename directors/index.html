	<div class="div1"><a class="content">I am Zihan Qu, a 16- year-old high school student from Shandong Experimental High School. I go by Hannah as swell.<BR>
'The Story of Your Life' is the first short film I produced. Despite of the rough process, the extremely limited budget (192 USD) and the massive school work, my team and I managed to complete the film as quality as possible. I am really proud of us. <br>
It is my experience that gives me the inspiration. Up till today, I have been to over twenty countries, watched more than three hundred movies and eight hundred or so TV episodes, read about one thousand book and listened to six thousand songs. I am intrigued by the fascinating world, both genuine and virtual. As time went on, I am no longer satisfied with being the audience, I want to be the one who tells the story, who shares her ideas and experiences with the whole world. Thus, 'The Story of Your Life' was born. <br>
I write the script based on my former experience. In this story, the prototype of Hannah Shen is myself, and Lance Chen is several boys appeared in my life. Basically, I include all my most memorable moments and my very own thoughts towards this world in this film. A little crush alongside admiration from a boy, an argument on the my future major with my parents, the comparison between the 'six penny' and the 'moon', the recognition of myself, the things that I cherish and the things that I regret, etc. Thus, this film is about youth, dream and reality, disappointment and acceptance, elite and mundane, past and future. <br>
I include many possibilities of life, and I hope some parts would arouse people's sympathy. Please enjoy the film, and expect my further production.

		<div class="div1"><a class="content">I’m Lance Tan from Shandong Experimental High School, in Chinese called Shenshen Tan. As one of the directors of the movie The Story of Your Life, I would like to firstly express my gratitude towards all people in our crew, especially towards Hannah Qu, the director and the writer, and Unics Yu, the cameraman and the editor. One of them brings perfect script, and the other one makes it become reality.<br>
For me, I like to feel the mood from music and movies. So, when Hannah was explaining her creation of “Lance” in the movie for the first time, I became the only person that understood her totally. Actually, some of the behaviors of “Lance” in this movie just come from mine, which is a person who does not strive that hard, and who always imagines his success, partially.<br>
Honestly, this movie carries my wish to the people experiencing the life that “Lance” in the movie has experienced. I wish those like “Lance” in the movie not to be disappointed because of their high expectations on themselves which cannot be achieved; they would turn their fantasy into the motivation to strive in reality; and they could embrace the whole journey.<br>
Hope that all of you would have a nice experience watching our movie.
